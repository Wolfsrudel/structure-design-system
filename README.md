#### Design

Our Design System is designed in Sketch and [stored in Abstract](https://share.goabstract.com/0b159f72-b8fb-4441-9ccc-65a1a4ec995d) for sharing and organizing. If you don’t have access to Abstract, ask in [#proj-product-ds](https://hashicorp.slack.com/messages/C7KTUHNUS/).

## Contributing

#### What should go in Structure?

The most obvious candidate are those design patterns (or similar variants) used in multiple products. If you have a component you think we should be using or think that we could be doing something better, these are also good bets. Not sure? Ask in [#proj-product-ds](https://hashicorp.slack.com/messages/C7KTUHNUS/)
