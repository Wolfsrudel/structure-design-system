# Guide Drawer

The Guide Drawer helps a user learn about the product by letting them use the real UI.

| Add options to the drawer so that the user can choose where to go next. | A typical guide step includes instructive copy telling the user how to use the normal product interface and can include external links to more information. | Drawer content can include things like images, illustrations or videos. |

## Best Practices

### Guide Drawers:
- The drawer container should be fixed to the right of the viewport on desktop, 12px of spacing below the header and on the right and bottom sides
- The user should be able to easily dismiss the drawer through the "..." context menu in the upper right
- Use a section title, a page title, and instructive copy
- Indicate the progress through the progress bar including milestones
- The drawer should be hidden unless triggered by a Guide Trigger

### Drawer section titles:
- Keep the title short (preferably a single word for that feature)
- Use title-case
- Make sure the page titles and step titles match to help orient the user during multi-step tours

### Drawer content:
- Content should describe what the user is seeing on the screen
- Give the user instructions for what they should doÂ and why
- Include links to outside references such as Learn pages, Docs, API docs, videos, etc
- Rely on docs to provide depth of knowledge rather than distract from the page content
- Give the user an expectation of time required ("About 10 minutes") next to the Start button when choosing features to tour
- Do not use acronyms or product-specific jargon without explaining them

### Drawer progress bars:
- The progress bar should show a tooltip on hover showing the section title and "Step X of Y". Do not include the step copy elsewhere in the drawer.
- Always end the last step showing the final milestone as completed and include congratulatory copy
- Never show an empty progress bar when the user is on the first step. If they are on step 1 of 3, think of it as 0 of 4 and show the bar 25% filled. This helps the user feel that they've already started just by being in the right place.
