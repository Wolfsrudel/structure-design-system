# Tooltip

Tooltips are used to provide infrequently accessed, supporting information that would otherwise clutter the user interface. 

## Visual Examples

## Best Practices

- Content should be brief, usually no longer than one or two sentences. 
- The tooltip should be positioned so that the content is fully visible within the viewport.
- The arrow should point toward the triggering element.
- The default position, relative to the triggering element, is down right. 
- Variations enable the tooltip to be positioned either above or below the triggering element with left, center, or right biasing. 
- The tooltip container should fit the content width. In cases of long strings, a max-width is enforced and the text should wrap.
- Because they require users to actively engage with them, tooltips are not ideal for conveyinh critical and/or frequently-accessed information.
