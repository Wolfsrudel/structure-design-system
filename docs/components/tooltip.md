# Tooltip

Tooltips are used to provide  explanatory information that would otherwise clutter the user interface. 

## Visual Examples

| Default | Long Text |
 | --- | --- | 
| ![Default tooltip](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mQ9dWOHT1eIXwURSZKwtKSWGaZDJn4L_) | ![Tooltip with long text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1PoQAJShCMW2xzBK02XwYrrUuRIiL8iAx) |
| Default positioning is bottom left, but this can be overridden. The arrow should point toward the triggering element.  | The tooltip container should fit the content width. In cases of long strings, a max-width is enforced and the text should wrap. | 

## Best Practices

- Content should be brief, usually a phrase long and rarely exceeding two sentences. 
- The tooltip should be positioned so that the content is fully visible within the viewport.
- Variations enable the tooltip to be positioned either above or below the triggering element with left, center, or right biasing. 
- Because they require users to actively engage with them, tooltips are not ideal for conveying critical and/or frequently-accessed information.
